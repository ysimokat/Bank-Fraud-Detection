    "# Credit Card Fraud Detection: Data Exploration Tutorial\n",
    "\n",
    "## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Objectives\n",
    "By the end of this tutorial, you will:\n",
    "- Understand how to explore a fraud detection dataset\n",
    "- Learn to identify class imbalance and its implications\n",
    "- Discover which features are most important for fraud detection\n",
    "- Create visualizations to understand data patterns\n",
    "- Handle missing values and outliers\n",
    "\n",
    "## ðŸ“Š What is This File About?\n",
    "The `data_exploration.py` file is our starting point for understanding the credit card fraud dataset. It performs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** - the crucial first step in any machine learning project.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why is EDA important?**\n",
    "- Helps us understand our data before building models\n",
    "- Reveals patterns and anomalies\n",
    "- Identifies data quality issues\n",
    "- Guides feature engineering decisions"
