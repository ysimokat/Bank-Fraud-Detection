The complete pipeline has 10 phases:

INTEGRATED PIPELINE (Phases 1-6):
- Phase 1: Basic ML Models (Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Neural Network, Anomaly Detection)
- Phase 2: Enhanced Models (XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost with cost-sensitive learning)
- Phase 3: Deep Learning (Focal Loss, Weighted BCE, Autoencoders)
- Phase 4: Graph Neural Network (GraphSAGE, GAT)
- Phase 5: Model Calibration (Platt Scaling, Isotonic Regression)
- Phase 6: Ensemble Creation (Voting, Weighted Average)

ADVANCED PIPELINE (Phases 7-10):
- Phase 7: Heterogeneous GNN (Multi-relational graphs)
- Phase 8: Online Streaming (Real-time fraud detection)
- Phase 9: Hybrid Ensemble (Context-aware meta-learning)
- Phase 10: Active Learning (Human-in-the-loop)
